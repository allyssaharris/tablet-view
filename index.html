          <h2>Our Story </h2>
          <p id="content">As if in the blink of an eye, the world changed. 2020 will, undoubtedly, be recorded as one of the most pivotal years the world has ever seen. Countless things shifted; our perspectives, politics, faith in humanity, and the way we relate to our fellow human beings. We also missed out on the little things. A handshake, a hug, a helpful hand in the grocery store.

            Some of us missed out on coffee shops. 
            
            Like most people, I had an endless stream of quarantine hobbies; macrame, bread baking, at-home ceramics. I also made coffee. I decided if I couldn’t go to the coffee shop, I’d bring it to me. I (using my stimulus money) bought an espresso machine, coffee grinder, pour over, and teapot. My roommate baked sweets, made breakfast sandwiches, and perfected the zucchini loaf. My other roommate… well, someone had to taste-test the recipes. By the end of quarantine, you couldn't tell the difference between a Starbucks and our apartment.
            
            When the world started to open, I, like many Americans, found myself in need of a job. Although I had never worked in a coffee shop before, I had all the skills necessary to be a barista. Within a few weeks, I had my first gig. I have loved it ever since.
            
            I hope that this site can be a resource for others to learn more about the ins and outs of coffee. Whether you want to impress your friends at home, or need an edge applying for you next gig, I hope
