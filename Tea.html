            <h2>1. Choose and Measure Out Your Tea</h2>
            
            <p> There are thousands of tea varieties, but they can all more or less be put into one of five categories: white, green, oolong, black or dark (pu-erh from China’s Yunnan Province being the dominant dark). But they're brewed the same way tea is, so keep reading.
              
              Once you've chosen your tea, measure it out. The perfect tea-to-water ratio is personal—some people prefer stronger teas, some prefer them light—so you're going to want to experiment. But a good starting point is one teaspoon of loose tea per cup of water. (Using this ration, a teapot that holds four cups of water will require four teaspoons of tea.)</p>
