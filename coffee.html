          <h2>What Makes A Good Cup of Coffee? </h2>
          <p>Do you remember the first cup of coffee? Even before I was old enough to drink it, coffee smelled like waking up. It felt like the start of a new morning.  Like many people, my mom would always make a big pot of coffee in the morning for herself and my dad when they were getting ready. While everyone can appreciate the convenience and nostalgia of a big drip pot of joe, there are so many other fantastic and convenient ways to enjoy coffee! And we’re NOT talking about keurigs. From the classic pour over, to the french press and moka pot, below you can find some inexpensive and delicious methods to make your morning brew! </p>

        <h2>Pour Over</h2>
        
        <p> Pour-over coffee is coffee at its most basic: just you, a cup, a filter, and a funnel, without any machines to get in the way. By pouring a slow, steady stream of hot water over coffee grounds, you can extract a full-flavored but delicate cup of coffee with more nuance and subtlety than you’d get with a drip machine or French press.</p>
